<h1> Elasticities</h1>

<h2>Price elasticity of DEMAND: </h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> -The most common measure used to
determine consumers' sensitivity to price</li>
 <li> -The proportional change
in demand given a change in price</li>
 <li> -Measures how a
percentage change in price of a good will affect demand for that good</li><br>
</ul>
</p>

<p class = 'desc'>
INELASTIC GOODS: Consumers will continue to demand the good, regardless of the
price. Insulin is an example of an inelastic good: patients that require insulin will continue to pay
almost any price for it.

<p class = 'desc'>
ELASTIC GOODS: Consumers stop demanding the product as
prices increase. Restaurant meals are an example of an elastic good: most consumers will eat at restaurants less as the price of a meal increases.

  <h2>Price elasticity of SUPPLY: </h2>

 <p>

 <ul>
 <li>-Measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price</li>
 <li>-Necessary for a firm to know how quickly, and effectively, it can respond to changing market conditions, especially to price changes
 </li>
 </p>
<p class = 'desc'>
INELASTIC SUPPLY: An increase in price causes a smaller % change in supply. It means firms have difficulty increasing supply in response to a rise in price.

Potatoes in the short term. If the price of potatoes goes up, farmers cannot increase supply because it depends how many seeds they put in the ground in March.
Nuclear Power. It would take considerable time to increase the supply of nuclear power because you need skilled labour, and it would take a long time to build.

<p class = "desc">
ELASTIC SUPPLY: An increase in price causes a bigger % change in supply. It means firms can easily increase supply in response to a change in price.

Firms operating below full capacity. If a car factory is operating at 70% capacity, then it can easily increase supply and produce more cars in response to changes in price.
